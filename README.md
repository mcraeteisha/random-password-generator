## Work Completed

To complete this project, I created an HTML and CSS file to build my portfolio.

Using VS Code, I completed the following:

* Created an HTML page using semantic HTML elements.
* Created a CSS page and used flexbox to layout and organize elements on the page.
* Added images to my website, as well as a link to my resume.
 
## Learnings
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings Iâ€™m taking away from this project are:
1. I learned that you can apply multiple classes to one element within your HTML. (Shoutout to my TA!)
2. CSS Flexbox can be incredibly tricky. Understanding different Flexbox properties seems easy enough, but implementing them on the page was a challenge.
3. Responsive webpages are important, but can also be difficult to nail down at times.
4. In the future, I'll plan to keep my HTML as simple as possible. I definitely got carried away here with nesting elements and giving them classes.
