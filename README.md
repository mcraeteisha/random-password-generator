# random-password-generator
Random Password Generator created using HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript.

Using unique passwords for your online accounts is important when it comes to protecting your personal information. 

This Password Generator application allows employees to keep their sensitive data secure with passwords that meet specified criteria. Passwords can have anywhere between 8 and 128 characters and can include lowercase, uppercase, special, and numeric characters. The end result of using the Password Generator is a strong password that offers more security for online accounts.

## Learnings
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings I’m taking away from this project are:
1. How to use for loops to gather random pieces of a string.
2. That anytime you are returning information from a function, you should shore the function in a variable. (Props to my TA for this info!)
3. When thinking about organinzing a page of JavaScript, it can be broken into three parts: Reference Elements at the top, Functions in the middle, and Run Function/Event Listeners at the bottom.
